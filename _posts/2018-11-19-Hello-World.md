This blog was created using [Jekyll-Now](http://www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). To retain the simplicity of creating posts without having to publish from a local copy, I used styles from [Chalk](http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/) but didn't actually install it. Thank you Barry and Nielsen.

To get started with [Jekyll-Now](http://www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now):
1. Bop on over to [Jekyll-Now](http://www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and smash the Fork button (on the top right).
2. But first, create a GitHub account. Sorry, I thought you had one already.
3. Click the Settings button in your newly forked repository, and change the name of the repository to <yourusername>.github.io. This means you have a user website which Github Pages serves up automatically. It's at http://<yourusername>.github.io.
4. Edit the _config.yml file to set the options you want. GitHub Pages takes a moment to rebuild the website when you commit the file.
5. Use [Prose](Prose) to create/edit posts or just do it in GitHub with the help of [the Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
  
To use your own domain name instead of github.io:
1. Edit the CNAME file in the root of your repository to include your domain name.
2. Add a cname DNS record using whatever means your domain name registrar provides.

Jekyll has some useful advanced features. Check out [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/) and [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).
