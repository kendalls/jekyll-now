Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens.

Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens.

Nope, here are a few of my favourite things. I got a bit sidetracked when I started designing and printing the things I needed.

1. [Helicopter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1885007) - If using PETG, decrease the bed temperature by 5 degrees, and decrease the extrusion multiplier to 0.99 to make everything fit nicely. Printing the body in PLA and the rotor in PETG doesn't work (with the default settings). There's too much tolerance between the body and the rotor gear for it to spin properly and fly up. 
2. [Squishy Turtles](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2238443) - I needed an excuse to buy coloured filament.
3. [Mini Monster Truck](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1557428) - This was a fun way of testing pausing the print and switching colour (on the tyres).
4. [Elephant](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:257911) - This was one of the first things I printed because the printed in place joints intrigued me. I also learned to use adaptive layer height with Slic3r to smooth out the top of the elephant's back.
5. [Maker Faire Robot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:331035) - This little guy is just cool. He almost printed without support but one arm popped off the print bed and got a bit squirrely.
6. [Giant Lego Flower](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2222088) - I like Lego. The first thing I printed with support.

These were all printed on a Prusa i3 MK# using eSun PLA+ filament.
