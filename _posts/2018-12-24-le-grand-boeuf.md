Charal, launched a few months ago, marks a step change in design for the IMOCA 60 class. 

Unlike most of the IMOCA 60's which carried foils in the 2016 Vendee Globe and were retrofitted with them, Charal has been specifically designed around the foils.
The boat will be safe but not competitive if it loses a foil.
The previous generation of boats were designed to be competitive without the foils since they hadn't been proven to be reliable and effective across all the wind ranges typically experienced in the race.

So what does this mean for the design? 
Instead of trying to balance a low weight hull with one capable of supporting a powerful rig, the designers, VPLP, tried to provide a lightweight and minimal drag hull form.
The larger foils and the required hull reinforcement adds half a tonne weight penalty over the last generation foils. The foils are large enough that they can't both be retracted at the same time.
This means hull volume has been reduced wherever possible to save weight. 
Volume has been retained forward and amidships but the bow is heavily chamfered and slopes down to a very low transom. 
The waterline is narrower too but still provides enough righting moment to meet the class stability rule.

The foils are powerful enough that Charal starts foiling in 15 knots of breeze. Their power is limited by the class-restricted rig however.
The mast is designed for a maximum load of 32 tonne metres, whereas Charal can generate 43-45 tonne metres when foiling with full rake, full ballast, and the keel fully canted.
The foils have five fibre optic sensors in addition to the ones on the rake adjustment bearing for the foils, the outriggers, and the backstay to trigger an alarm when the load is greater than designed for.

It's going to be interesting to see how the boat goes, having withdrawn from it's first race in the Defi Azimut with electrical issues.
